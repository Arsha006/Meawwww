Project Description
A fun, browser-based web app where you record your best animal impression, and a completely different animal roasts you with sarcastic humor, images, and background music.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People worldwide are suffering from an epidemic of un-roasted animal sounds. These sounds go unchallenged, allowing humans to think they can impersonate a lion without consequences.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Natureâ€™s Roast provides an interactive way for random animals to sarcastically roast your animal impressionsâ€”complete with visuals, background tracks, and floating emojisâ€”because why not?
